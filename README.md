In this project, we will be designing and implementing a digital version of the Clue/Cluedo game using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles. The game revolves around a murder mystery and players are tasked with solving the crime by collecting clues and making deductions. The graphics will be simple and will show a rudimentary game board along with the location of each player. The structure of the board will look similar to the picture shown in appendix 1. The graphics will likely be done with Swing JFrame. The user will be able to select how many ‘AI’ players they would like to play against (between 2 and 5).  When the game starts, the answer ‘envelope’ will be instantiated and the correct murderer, weapon, and location will be randomly determined. Then, each player will take turns moving around the board and learning information. The players will then make guesses about what is in the envelope until someone is correct. Thus, by designing and implementing a digital version of the game using OOAD principles, we aim to provide players with a rewarding and engaging gaming experience.
